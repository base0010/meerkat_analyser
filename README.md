##Meerkat Analyser Frontend

NOTE: to get detailed information about whats going on you need to open the JS Console (I couldn't get Three.js to display text ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ .... refresh page to get the correct new number of accounts

* On page load displays Meerkats total to the number of accounts created across all blocks/chunks
* "render studio" generates the amount of NEAR Studio IDE accounts created across all blocks/chunks that are saved on the backend
* getAccountsInBlock takes a blocknumber and renders the accounts in that block 

BUGS/TODOS: 

Sometimes the camera gets confused and meerkats disapper (zooming out fixes this) 

Refactor Websockets
